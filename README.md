# MCMAPI
An Efficient and time-friendly minigame API for easily making minigames such as BedWars and etc.

MCMAPI (standing for Minecraft Minigame API) is one of the best minigame API packed with related AND unrelated features/utilities

This includes BUT not limited to:
- Built-in High-performance GUIs
- Built-in non-blocking Asynchronous Scheduler/Runner for ease of use and time saving.
- Built-in Arena Setup Handling.
- Event Handling States with Optional Asynchronous Handling.
- Kotlin Support (Special Remade Code for Kotlin to achieve null safety and performance)

This library works best with [FlameWare](https://github.com/coderFlameyosFlow/FlameWare) (my own command library) or [Lamp](https://github.com/Revxrsal/Lamp); Both are solid annotation-based command libraries to help you make minecraft related commands in a much more time AND syntax friendly way.
